TODO:
- Figure out why Event::addEdge doesn't work with strings. (I can avoid it for now.)

Ideas:
- Orphan any traces within a request that start but do not complete before the request exit? Depends on if the server is smart enough to understand that--entry event MUST be sent due to timestamping in sendReport.

Concerns:
- How to handle cancelables? (ie: setTimeout, setInterval)
