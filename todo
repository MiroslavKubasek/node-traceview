TODO:
- change Event::addInfo to Event::set and add Event::get? (oboe does not appear to support getting info)
- Figure out why Event::addEdge doesn't work with strings. (I can avoid it for now.)
- Use continuation-local-storage to track layer references across async boundaries.
- Allow Layer construct to be a two-event sync trace or four-event async trace.
- Track stack unwinding to link and send events in correct order on the way out.
- Correctly link edges of parallel async actions that could resolve in a non-deterministic order.
- Make sure low-level log.js and trace.js work correctly, without needing to handle context internally.
- Port over request sampling to work with new layer tracer, when I figure out what the API is.
- Cleanup old stuff in index.js--the bottom half will not apply anymore, when layer tracing API is done.

Ideas:
- Orphan any traces within a request that start but do not complete before the request exit? Depends on if the server is smart enough to understand that--entry event MUST be sent due to timestamping in sendReport.

Concerns:
- How to handle cancelables? (ie: setTimeout, setInterval)
