TODO:
- Figure out why Event::addEdge doesn't work with strings. (I can avoid it for now.)
- More http probe tests
  - Validate behaviour of asynchrony within a request
  - Validate X-Forwarded-* headers get added to http entry event
  - Upstream latency headers (x-request-start, x-queue-start, x-queue-time)
  - Validate `always` trace mode behaviour

Ideas:
- Orphan any traces within a request that start but do not complete before the request exit? Depends on if the server is smart enough to understand that--entry event MUST be sent due to timestamping in sendReport.

Concerns:
- How to handle cancelables? (ie: setTimeout, setInterval)
