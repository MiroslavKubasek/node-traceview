# nodoboe

Node.js instrumentation

## Dependencies

- Linux
- node.js v0.10 (v0.11 support is almost working)
- liboboe installed at standard lib path

## Installation

First, run `npm install` to install the node modules it depends on. Then run
`npm test` to check the test status. Several tests are currently skipped (The
light blue ones), as they crash the process. I haven't yet figured out why.
